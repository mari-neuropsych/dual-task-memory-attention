# Dual Task â€“ Memory & Attention Challenge

Idea:  
A GUI program that combines a working memory (N-Back) task and an attention target detection task. Participants must remember a sequence of stimuli while responding to target items, simulating multitasking in cognitive neuroscience experiments.

Objective:  
- Demonstrate understanding of dual-task performance and cognitive load.  
- Collect reaction time, accuracy, and memory performance.  
- Practice interactive GUI programming and data recording.

How it works:  
The program displays stimuli for memory (N-Back) while random target items appear. Participants respond to targets and recall items as required. Reaction time, accuracy, and memory performance are recorded for analysis.

Usage:  
Run the script in Python. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete both tasks. Results will be printed in the console.
